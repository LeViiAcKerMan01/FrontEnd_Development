<!--  NOTES  
  
1- Background - It is a property by the help of which you can 
pass url of an image or linear gradient aswell

properties of background is that whenever you pass the url of an 
image, the image might not be visible sometimes, to make it visible, 
use background-size as COVER
there are other options too such as CONTAIN which will try to fit in the image irrespective of div size
NOTE - best thing is to use the COVER instead of contain
