<!--  NOTES
  
1- FlexBox - When you need elements to be on the same line and have control over them.
It is a better way of doing this instead of using inline and inline block.

y axis - cross axis(height wali cross axis hogi)
x axis = main axis

NOTE: elements ki arrangement ki direction hume main axis k baare m btayegi
- main axis main work krne k liye hota hai JUSTIFY-CONTENT
- and side items mein work krne ke liye hota hai ALIGN_ITEMS

MAIN AXIS by default left to right aligned hoti hai.

- there are various options in while we are using JUSTIFY-CONTENT
for example: center, space-evenly, space-around, space-between and end.

- there are many options while we are using ALIGN-ITEMS and those are
for example: end, center etc
